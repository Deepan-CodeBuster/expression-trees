# expression-tree-gen
Building an expression tree of an arithmetic expression is something quite useful and it is one of the steps a compilers must take to generate machine code.

With that in mind, and inspired on my lectures on the tree data structure I decided to create a web app that simulates the creation of such a tree given an expression.

Visit this [website](https://lnogueir.github.io/expression-tree-gen/) to simulate an expression yourself.

* This [article](http://ice-web.cc.gatech.edu/ce21/1/static/audio/static/pythonds/BasicDS/InfixPrefixandPostfixExpressions.html) which introduced me to Dijkstra's Shunting-yard algorithm.
* The [mycodeschool](https://www.youtube.com/user/mycodeschool) youtube channel with great videos explaning the algorithms said above.
